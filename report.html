            <li>I didn't work in pairs but I got approval for this.</li>
            <li>My service is for stocks.</li>
            <li>All the request data is created/read/updated/deleted from MySQL database.</li>
            <li>Uses Express as shown in the first several lines of code.</li>
            <li>The endpoints are named appropriately. Ticker for the stock ticker, id for the id of the analysis, like for like, and dislike for dislike. </li>
            <li>Each endpoint receives and sends data as JSON.</li>
            <li>Create, read, update, and delete are supported. </li>
            <li> I blocked all ports except 22, 80, 443, and 8443.</li>
            <li>Nginx server was created.</li>
            <li>*** The web service must support cross-origin resource sharing using custom middleware and an options wildcard endpoint.</li>
            <li>I installed and started pm2 to run index.js.</li>
            <li>I stored on GitHub and shared with hcientist.</li>
            <li>I included the creation and schema scripts with the password removed.</li>
            <li> Didn't do too good on this one because I finished almost everything in a single day since it mirrored the lab, but at least all my commits weren't on a single day.</li>
            <li>***Have your service respond to https://project2.YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME:8443/report.html by sending back an HTML page with brief report containing an itemized breakdown of how you believe you have met the expectations listed above.
                please include very explcitly the URLs and requests you are expecting:
                document the endpoints that your service provides.
                Describe each endpointâ€™s purpose, HTTP method, path, parameters, any expected body content, and response.</li>
